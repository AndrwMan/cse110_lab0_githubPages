### Andrew Man's GitPage
3rd Year Computer Science student interested in applying algorithms
to the **financial sector** (think trading algos). My hobbies include discovering game development in my spare time and using *styled* fonts.

>It's a Feature not a Bug
All jokes aside my philsophy is it is more productive to look for a 
silver lining in everything, and that includes code. Encountering bugs is 
is the best way to learn to program better. Its inevitable anyways, so get 
back to `print`ing.

## My current aspirations
Currently I aspire to design a course schedule that would balance incoming 
internships/work (the professional experience I need) with my academic 
interests and also is resistant to CSE department waitlists. To this end
I heavily utilize UCSD's course [catalog](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/front/courses.html)) and [offerings](https://cse.ucsd.edu/index.php/undergraduate/tentative-course-offerings).
[This is the engineer that I strive to be](/cse110_inspiration.jpg) 

## Future endeavors
As of now here is my plan to becoming a full-fledge software engineer
- [x] Finish lab0, my favorite lab (including GitPage with all my favorite features such as...)
    - Headings
    - Styling text
    - Quoting text
    - Quoting code
    - External Links
    - Lists
        1. Ordered List
        2. Unordered List
        3. Task List
- [ ] Stop using print statements so much and use the debugger
- [ ] Complete all the machine learning courses at UCSD and enter a
saturated workforce with this specialization

Thanks for listening!
